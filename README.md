Climate Compliance Tracker
Project Overview
The Climate Compliance Tracker is an interactive dashboard designed to visualize and analyze carbon emissions, renewable energy usage, and climate policies across various countries. This project aims to provide stakeholders with insights into how different nations are addressing climate change through data-driven approaches.

Tools Used
Database: PostgreSQL
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation
SQLAlchemy for database connection
Plotly for data visualization
Framework: Dash for creating the interactive web application
What We Did
Database Creation: We structured a PostgreSQL database with the following tables:

Countries: Holds country information including name, continent, and population.
Emissions: Contains carbon, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions data by year and country.
Policies: Records climate-related policies implemented in each country.
Renewables: Tracks the percentage of renewable energy usage per year by country.
Data Ingestion: Using Python and SQLAlchemy, we fetched data from the PostgreSQL database into Pandas DataFrames for analysis.

Data Cleaning: We conducted data quality checks, ensuring there were no missing values and cleaning the datasets accordingly.

Data Analysis: Basic analyses were performed to compute total carbon emissions and average renewable energy percentages by country.

Data Visualization: Using Plotly, we created engaging visualizations, including bar charts and line graphs, to depict the findings clearly.

Interactive Dashboard: Developed a Dash application that allows users to interact with the data, filter by country, and view specific emissions and policy details.

Conclusion
The Climate Compliance Tracker successfully demonstrates the power of data analytics in understanding climate actions across different countries. Through visualizations, users can easily grasp complex data and identify trends in emissions and renewable energy usage.

Recommendations
Expand Dataset: Incorporate additional countries and more detailed emission types for comprehensive analysis.
Enhance Visualizations: Include more advanced interactive charts and features, such as time series analyses and predictive modeling.
User Feedback: Implement a feedback mechanism within the dashboard to understand user experience and areas for improvement.
Suggestions
Explore integrating APIs to pull real-time emissions and climate policy updates.
Consider adding user authentication for a more personalized experience.
Develop a mobile-friendly version of the dashboard for broader accessibility.
